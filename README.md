# este-docker

This repository contains Dockerfile that creates image with node, npm and este.

Why?
----

I had some problems running the node stack on my dev machine (fresh versions of node and npm needed etc.), so I decided to do it in Docker, because Docker provides clean and deterministic environment (kind of like git for whole operating system).

This Dockerfile is good only for Este demo (without the hassle of installing all the node modules). But it can also serve as inspiration for your own web apps.
